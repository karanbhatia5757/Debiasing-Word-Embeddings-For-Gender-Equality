# Debiasing-Word-Embeddings-For-Gender-Equality.
Debiasing Non-Gender Specific Words for Gender Equality.
This repository contains code to remove gender bias from non-gender specific words for gender equality.<br>
Ideas here are implemented from a paper by Boliukbasi et al. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06520).<br>
The GloVe word embeddings are taken from Jeffrey Pennington, Richard Socher, and Christopher D. Manning. (https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).
